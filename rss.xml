            <title><![CDATA[The Trusty Trio]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>For the past 19 months, I have been living outside the US. Sometimes, one just needs a break from familiarity, monotony, and the same mindset. It's like how artists step away from their work and later revisit it with fresh eyes. Well, that's pretty much me. I knew with the next election coming up, I had to step away. Mostly, I knew I had settled into the life of someone I just didn't want be. Fulfillment was missing from my work life, friends were cool, but I never got to see them anymore because I was just too drained from work, AND my living situation in Orlando was less than ideal for many reasons. </p>]]></description>
